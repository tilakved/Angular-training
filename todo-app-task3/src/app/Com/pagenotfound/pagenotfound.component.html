<h1>Page Not Found</h1>
<p>This file does not exist and there was no index.html found in the current directory or 404.html in the root
  directory.</p>
<h1>Why am I seeing this?</h1>
<p>You may have deployed the wrong directory for your application. Check your firebase.json and make sure the public directory is pointing to a directory that contains an index.html file.</p>
<p>  You can also add a 404.html in the root of your site to replace this page with a custom error page.</p>
